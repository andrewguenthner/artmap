### Why This?

**Because a city full of beauty that's widely shared does enormous public good.**  

Imagine living, working, or visiting Oakland, and, every day, being inspired by the beauty of yuor surroundings.  If you haven't had such an experience, then maybe you've missed the work of thousands of artists all around Oakland, who want to share their creations with you!  These inspiring works of art are all around us, but often we simply don't know where (and when) to find them.  We need information, delivered in a way that is easy for everyone to acces and understand.  Without it, we lose much of the public good that could come from all the time and effort invested to create and maintain public art.

### Why Us?

**because a strong partnership between "tech" and "art" is a great way to bridge technology and community for a thriving and equitable Oakland**

The visual arts are one of many ways that our community expresses itself.  Often they are a key form of expression for those who lack access to other means of communication.  Part of our mission of "civic hacking", then, is to ensure that the messages shared by artists are heard and appreciated throughout the community.  

### Why Now?

**because a strong partnership can help to ensure that "tech" and "art" benefit from sharing a crowded community**

A crowded community can greatly enhance the value of public art by making it accessible to a larger audience -- but only if that audience can find and experience it.  As the historically thriving arts community in Oakland is joined by a newly thriving tech community, now is the time to ensure that both communities benefit from the interaction.
