### Before You Dive In ...

* To run and test the scraping code, you need to obtain an API key from Mapbox.  Your key needs to be placed in your local copy of the config.js file.  Please, if you push to Github, make sure your key is not published by
changing config.js back to "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"  

* Running the scraper will take about 10 minutes, so, if you want to test extensively, consider using a finite loop with just a few iterations, rather than the over 600 needed to collect all the data.  

### We Appreciate The Support of OpenOakland and Oakland Art Murmur Volunteers -- Thank You



You can learn more about some of the above by looking through this repository.  We try to make our code extremely well-commented so that anyone, at any level, can see how it works.  If you are not sure how you can help, just ask.  

If you are a "beginner", "just want to learn", "not an experienced coder", or "not sure how to do it", then we especially would like you to be on our team!  The project leaders will be happy to help you use our work as a learning opportunity!
