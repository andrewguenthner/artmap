###We Appreciate Your Help
You can:
* Communicate project information with non-technical users (this is our greatest need -- to show and explain what we can do)
* Organize, teach, and train others at our data gathering events
* Contribute data -- add a photo, or check a geo-location
* Help us give credit -- do some sleuthing to help us verify the identity of artists and data providers, amd make sure we are properly recognizing them
* Advocate for beauty in your own neighborhood
* Develop new tools that share Oakland's beauty with everyone here.  These include:
** Geo-data processing tools
** Data scraping tools
** Web apps to automate processes
** Web site plug-ins (WordPress especially)
** Video tutorials to guide volunteers in organizing and maintaining data
** Written documentation that describe processes for organizing and maintaining data

Some specific items we are working on right now:
** Updating a web scraper to provide more detailed information about murals
** Documenting and demonstrating a workflow to update marker maps with art gallery categorical data
** Building and deploying demonstration maps for future Oakalnd Art Murmur web sites

You can learn more about some of the above by looking through this repository.  We try to make our code extremely well-commented so that anyone, at any level, can see how it works.  If you are not sure how you can help, just ask.  

If you are a "beginner", "just want to learn", "not an experienced coder", or "not sure how to do it", then we especially would like you to be on our team!  The project leaders will be happy to help you use our work as a learning opportunity!
