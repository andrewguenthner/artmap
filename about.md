# Project Goal:

Enhanced tools that share Oakland's beauty with everyone

### Specifically in this context...

**Enhanced** can be measured by improved public access (including individuals who have difficulty accessing visual resource information), automation that reduces the effort required to gather, maintain, and make use of information, better visualization and organization that more effectively communicates content and connects audiences, and information management practices that facilitie reproducibility, minimization of effort, and ease of future adaptation and scaling of tools for use in multiple locales

**Tools** include publicly-available data, organized data sets, software, information-sharing platforms, documentation, maps, guides, or other information sources that connect visual artwork to the public

**Oakland's beauty** refers to works of visual art that people who live, work, or visit Oakland could experience for free in the course of routine personal travel in and around the area

**Everyone** includes a special focus on people or groups that either currently lack or have historically lacked the means to reach a wide audience or to experience public visual art
